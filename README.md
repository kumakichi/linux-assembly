This is a repository for linux assembly language code snippets.

Files in directory `intel` are written in Intel Style using [NASM](http://nasm.us/); in directory `att` means AT&T Style.

Many code snippets come from 《Assembly Language Step-by-Step》 written by Jeff Duntemann and 《Professional Assembly Language》written by Richard Blum.
