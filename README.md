This is a repository for linux assembly language code snippets.

Files with a suffix 's'(lower case) are written in Intel Style; suffix with 'S'(upper case) means AT&T Style.

Many code snippets come from 《Assembly Language Step-by-Step》 written by Jeff Duntemann and 《Professional Assembly Language》written by Richard Blum.
